# What Do English Learners Struggle With The Most?

In this project I take a dive into the [English Stack Exchange](https://english.stackexchange.com/) website to try and figure out if I can identify what areas of English learners have the most trouble with. I was an English teacher in South Korea for six years, and I had the opportunity to meet and teach many individuals ranging from 4-15 years old. I have first-hand experienece with English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) students, and I have seen many of them get stuck on certain concepts. I know what kind of problems a lot of students face with English, but I want to see if I can quanitify it through the stack exchange site.

## Goals For This Project:
* Query the database for a good set of data
* Clean and analyze the data
* Visualize any interesting patterns or relationships
* Quanitfy and find any insight as to why so many people struggle with English
